# a decision to produce

## no shortage of ideas

I find I have no shortage of application and business ideas, but I don't posses the knowledge to execute. I thought learning Vue would give me the correct tools for the job. Wait I don't know how to do user authentication and authorization. Angular is connected to google, they surely have all the tools to get me started. Svelte is a lot more lightweight and people love using that. Supabase has authentication, and authorization. I think Go and HTMX are up and coming, there are SDK's for that. React has everything I need I just need to configure it correctly. How do I deploy anything. Where do I get an SSL certificate. Is everyone doing this? Why is it so hard for me? How do I get a website past localhost without making a next app and using vercel. I don't understand all the templates, and how to adapt them to my aplications needs. 

## a choice to proceed

I'm going to learn and deliver with Laravel. Is it the best option? Idk. Is it performant? Idk. Is it easy? Idk. Can I deploy easily? Idk. Is there good authentication/authorization? Idk. I don't know PHP. I don't know all the standard ways to do things. 
I'm going to see it through and answer those things for myself. I want to generate my own opinion and start my real web-dev journey with Laravel.

## first steps?

I'm going to start where all noobs start, Laracast. Im going to walk through their series and see if I can get a good grasp of PHP and Laravel. Afterwhich I will take the basic tools to deliver a basic blog app. I want minimal styling, minimal features.
